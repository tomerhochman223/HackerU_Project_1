            <img src="images/latoya.jpg" alt="mardi gras" style="width: 300px; float: right;">
            In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former District
            B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election, candidate
            Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote.[13]
            Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.[14]
            <br>
            As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced a bill
            banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on
            service industry workers.[15] The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.[16]
            <br>
            Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to by
            residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to
            the downtown site of the former VA Hospital.[17][18] In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large
            council member Jason Williams to register and inspect rental units in the city.[19]
            <br>
            As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime cameras
            in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing
            at the New Orleans Police Department.

            <img src="images/about1.jpg" alt="mardi gras" style="width: 300px; float: right;">
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
            Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
            Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each
            day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take
            place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
            Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).</p>
        <p class="faqText">
            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the
            same parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of
            Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes"
            are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known
            for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for
            naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly
            African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws
            are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.</p>
            <p class="faqText">While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major
            <img src="images/about1.jpg" alt="mardi gras" style="width: 300px; float: left; padding: 10px;">
            parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and
            Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
            Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
            weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the
            Courts" between Rex and Comus</p>

        <h1 class="faqHeader">History</h1>
        <p class="faqText">
            <img src="images/history1.jpg" alt="mardi gras" style="width: 300px; float: right;">
            The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the
            Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville,
            Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first
            celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating
            with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book
            An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of
            masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
            renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
            Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
            celebration.</p>
        <p class="faqText">In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret
            society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe,
            the Mystick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its
            celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a
            clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to
            Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a
            certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of
            how their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead
            in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the
            course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using
            Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a
            New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."[3]
            <img src="images/history1.jpg" alt="mardi gras" style="width: 300px; float: left; padding: 10px;">
            In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[4] War, economic, political, and weather
            conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
            Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.[4]</p>
        <p class="faqText">In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were
            canceled or moved to surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly
            fewer tourists than usual came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway,
            with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property
            but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the
            French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.</p>
        <p class="faqText">In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social
            organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate
            on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other
            public licenses.[5] Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes
            provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the
            distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade
            gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus
            <img src="images/history1.jpg" alt="mardi gras" style="width: 300px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
            and Momus stopped parading.[6] Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended
            its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.
        </p>
        <p class="faqText">Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as
            unconstitutional. Two federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an
            unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free association, and an
            unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance.[7] The US
            Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.

            Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone
            who pays dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.</p>
