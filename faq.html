                other questions,

                                135,000 participants. The combined parade routes covered 301 miles and the processions
                                were on the street for 204 hours.

                                On Mardi Gras, however, costuming is expected. Many New Orleanians go for the satirical,
                                the ironic, the bizarre or just
                                something pretty. Costumes are by no means a requirement, but Mardi Gras is a great time
                                to join the fun. Often,
                                families or groups of friends will don a group-themed costume. Often, the best costumes
                                tend to riff on current events.

                                home with bags of loot. There
                                are urban legends of New Orleanians having to reinforce their attics to support the

                                A word of caution: Beads are worn only during Carnival, and then, only if you've just
                                come from a parade. Tourists
                                identify themselves by wearing beads in the off-season.</p>
